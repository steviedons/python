When struggling to write a comprehension, donâ€™t panic. Start with a for loop first and copy-paste your way into a comprehension.

Any for loop that looks like this:

new_things = []
for ITEM in old_things:
    if condition_based_on(ITEM):
        new_things.append("something with " + ITEM)

Can be rewritten into a list comprehension like this:

new_things = ["something with " + ITEM for ITEM in old_things if condition_based_on(ITEM)]

If you can nudge a for loop until it looks like the ones above, you can rewrite it as a list comprehension.

# The above code worked but turned it into a comprehension

    bad_letters = [letter for letter in s if letter in bad_control]
    return str(len(bad_letters)) + '/' + str(len(s))

    # the sub removes any letters between a and m and then gets the length of what is left
